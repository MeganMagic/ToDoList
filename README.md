# To Do List Application
The project was started from [free redux course of Nomad Coders](https://nomadcoders.co/redux-for-beginners/lectures/1613)
I summarized the course on (my blog)[https://velog.io/@mari/3.-React-Redux%EB%A1%9C-ToDo-List-App-%EB%A7%8C%EB%93%A4%EA%B8%B0].

The goal of project is making to do list application which handles its data by using Redux.
App consist of a title, a text input box and a list. 

The Main functions are as following.

- Add a text to list
- Delete a text element from list
- Text elements with a link for each detail page
